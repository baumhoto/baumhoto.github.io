## Carreer

I've been a professional software developer for almost 10 years. While i was doing mostly Java during my University time and in my first job afterwards, i've been a C# developer since then writing Enterprise applications. Obviously you'll do some website stuff too (using ASP.NET in the past and WebAPI with Angular more recently). Recently we've started to use NodeJs (with AWS Lambda).

As i never changed my job after joining my current company in 2008 i'm also working on some legacy software written in Java 6, JSP 1.0 and even VB6. 

## Private

Computer nerd always interested to try out new OSes and software related to software development.  Other interests:
* Video Games
* Streaming (Netflix, Amazon) (Narcos, The Crown, The Americans etc. )
* Trekkie (watched the TNG and later stuff multiple times. TOS and Animated Series still on Todo list)

## Status
Single, propably because of all of the above:)
