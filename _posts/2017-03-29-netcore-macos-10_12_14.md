Yesterday i ran into the issue that debugging Net.Core in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) suddenly stopped working. Error message is `Unable to attach to CoreCLR`. After some investigation it turned out that the MacOS update to 10.12.4 pubished on Tuesday was to blame.

Fortunately there is a workaround available described in the following [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/10078) as long as the update has not been released.

In short you need to:

* download a [Nuget Package](https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v2/package/runtime.osx.10.10-x64.Microsoft.NETCore.Runtime.CoreCLR/1.1.2-servicing-25123-01)
* open it as a zip file and extract the following file: runtimes/osx.10.10-x64/native/libdbgshim.dylib
* copy the extracted file to the folder overwriting the existing one: ~/.vscode/extensions/ms-vscode.csharp-1.8.0/.debugger

After that debugging works again.
