    <p>Ok still figuring out how i will do multiple updates during a day.. propably will just add it at the top...
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/04/30/2016-macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboards-failing-twice-as-frequently-as-older-models
">AppleInsider</a> has collected some data on Macbook Pro 2016+ repair rates which states that they have increased with the redesigned models. I don't own one but there is rarely a day where at there at least is one <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/4277/dont-buy-the-new-macbook-pros-even-on-sale-in-my-opinion?zd=1&zi=5jafunva">post</a> complaining about it. Most complains are about the new keyboard which seems to have issues with keys stop working. Interestingly there hasn't been a replacement program for it, but for the batteries in the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/04/20/macbook-pro-no-touchbar-battery-replacement/">MBP 13 2016</a>.
I still own a 13 inch MBP 2013, but i also own a 12 inch Macbook 2015, which was the first Macbook with the new shallow Butterfly keys. I haven't had any issues with the keys, but i only use it as a hobby notebook.

Currently i would not buy an Macbook. First of all because they still use the last generation intel core cpu's and at least for the i3 and i5 versions the number of cores has duplicated (4 instead of 2) with the latest generation. 
Not sure about i7 version because they already had 4 cores afaik. Second i like to be able to install Linux natively via Dual boot and even after 1 1/2 years there is still stuff that is not <a href="https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux">working</a>. TouchId will never work but sound and hibernate should be. Third i think the touchbar is not useful. Main reason is because Apple limited it to only a few models (MBP 13 and 15) and all others Macbook, IMac don't get it. This is similar to 3D-Toch on Iphones which shares the same fate it is not available on all new IOS devices event though it has been introduced almost 3 years ago. 

So currently if you want to buy and Macbook Pro without the Touchbar you are forced to buy the entry-level macbook pro 13 inch. But as a programmer i want a beefier machine. Fortunately i don't need a new notebook right now, if i need one it would be a tough decision. Dell XPS 13, Lenovo Carbon X1 or Macbook Pro...
 </p> 
    <p>So what have i been up to latey:
    <ul>
        <li>quit my job as a programmer after 10 years at the same company and doing nothing right now ( sabbatical :) )</li>
        <li>haven't done much programming in the last months ... but i feel the need to do some programming again rises. propably the reason why i reactived this site ( no real programming though )</li>
        <li>bought myself a chromebook as i wanted to test it for some time.. i'm writing this blog-post with it but i will write an article about it</li>
        <li>this made me want to test Android on a real phone again, so i bought myself a pixel 2 xl last week... i will also write and article about it. so far i love it</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Have restructured the site a bit. I wanted to have a page where i could just post infos, thoughts etc. without the need to create on full article.
      But i wanted to still have the option to create articles when i want eleborate on a topic more. 
    </p> 
    <p>So by default the News-page of the site is loaded. But clicking on articles will open the old start page. So the News page will likely only contain text
      and links (no pictures). If i write an article i will link it in the news section. So let's see if this make me want to post more...
